<h2>Diabetes and Diet</h2>

<p>The plans have variable ratio of fats, proteins and carhohydrates</p>
<p>Generally, the following are recommended:</p>
<br>
<h3>Carbohydrates</h3>
<p>Carbohydrates should have low glycaemic loads and come from vegetables.</p>
<p>Fat and proteins should come from plant sources.</p>

<strong>NB.</strong>
<p>Glycaemic index is a scientific team used to measure the impact of carbohydrate on blood sugar.</p>
<p>Foods with low index raise blood sugar in modest terms and are thus better choices for patients with diabetes mellitus.</p>

<p><b>Complex cardohydrates</b> have <i>low glycaecmic indices</i>. These have in addition; fibre, vitamins and smaller amounts of proteins and fats. The latter tend to slow down the absorption of glucose and keep blood sugar levels in a less erratic state.</p>

<ul><li>Fermented dairy products decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease</li><li>Plant fats lower cardiovascular diseases. Sources of these include olive oil, seeds, avocado and nuts</li><li>Proportionately smaller amount of fat provides sateity and this works to advantage in reducing the tendency to overeat</li>

<p>Proteins are a steady source of energy and it does provide this without making the blood sugar to be erratic.
    They keep the blood sugar stable, provide sateity and contribute to the metabolism of the body.</p>

<p>Examples of good sources of protein include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Legumes such as beans, pea nuts</li>
<li>Eggs</li>
<li>Seafoods</li>
