<p>Non pharmacological management of osteoarthritis should be tried first, failure of which
    should provoke on-demand use of analgesics. A few of these modalities are advised below:</p>
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>The value of exercise in the control of pain associated with osteoarthritis cannot be overemphasised.
    It is estimated to be comparable to the magnitude of response when non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
    such as Ibuprofen, are used. Aerobic and strengthening exercises have been shown to help.</p>
<h3>Weight loss</h3>
<p>Among the causal factors of osteoarthritis is overweight and obesity. Evidence amounts
    to show that with a 10% in weight loss either by drugs or diet, there is an associated 50% reduction in
    pain scores from osteoarthritis in obese patients.</p>
<h3>Walking aids/knee braces</h3>

<p>Knee braces (if osteoarthritis of the knees) and or walking aids (hip joint involvement)
    would help to reduce pressures in inflamed joints and thereby aumenting the effect of analgesics.</p>
