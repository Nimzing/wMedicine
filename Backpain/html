ure that you do not take on an awkward position for a long time</li>

<li>Manual therapy such as massaging the site of pain</li>
<li>Exercise therapy</li>
<li>Comfort therapy - involves the following: exercise, heat or ice application to 
site of pain, applying lotions, indulging in music, art or drama. Pastoral counseling 
and positioning also fall in this category.</li>
<li>Neurostimulation involves the use of TENS (Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation), 
acupuncture and acupressure</li><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/40808537063_f97d5b0232_m.jpg" alt="Back massage" align="center"/>
<li>Practice good sleep posture. On your side is better than on the back. Let the mattress 
hug your body and not sag down</li>
<li>Trial of comedy - some people have reported benefits. This works
via distraction from paying too much attention to the pain thus 
retraining your brain /nerves to <q>reboot</q> the pain fibres.</li>
<li>Hypnosis; usually done via a doctor or a psychologist and can lead you to a state of 
altered consciousness. This altered state can help you to focus or narrow your attention in order 
to reduce any discomfort. Imagery, distraction and relaxation techniques are all possible manouvres
 employed for this to work.</li>
<li>Acupuncture has been tried in Chinese cultures with variable degrees of success.</li>
