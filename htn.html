<h2>Non Drug Management of Hypertension</h2>
<p>Systemic hypertension does always often respond to non pharmacological means. Sometimes, it is the only management that will be needed. Indeed, even with medications, it is important to continue on these non-drug management strategies:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Salt restriction
    </li>
    <p>Most foods contain sodium, the active ingredient of salt. In practice, no-salt added diet is the best strategy. Ensure modest application of salt and pay attention to eating foods
        that may have been preserved by excess salt application. Certain foods, traditional to some parts of the world fall into this category. Salted meats such as bacon, "bush meats",
        dried fish etc.</p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/40803941803_f0ca5ed608_m.jpg" alt="Salted fish" align="center" style="width:200px;height:200px;"/>

    <li>
        Potassium supplementation
    </li>
    <p>Unless contraindicated by chronic kidney disease or use of potassium drugs or those that impair potassium excretion, foods that contain potassium help to decease blood pressure.

    <li>
        Weight loss
    </li>
    <br></br>
    <p>The impact of weight loss is more pronounced if one is obese or overweight. Research suggests that for every 1Kg of weight loss, there is about 1mmHg drop in blood pressure reading.
        This may look negligible. But not if more weight loss is achieved! Done in a controlled manner could translate to eliminating the need to take medications.</p>

    <li>
        Dietary management - DASH diet
    </li>
    <p>DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension. This diet comprises of high vegetables, fruits, low-fat dairy products, whole grains, chicken, fish and nuts and low
        amounts of red meat, sweetened beverages and sweets. <img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7841/33705079588_ebb4fac985_m.jpg" alt="Trial" align="right" style="width:200px;height:200px;"/>The DASH diet intervention has been shown to achieve about 6mmHg of BP when compared to some typical western diets
        (amount for amount).</p>

    <li>
        Exercise
    </li>
    <p>Exercise works independent of weight loss. An average reduction of blood pressure of about 5mmHg can be achieved when one embarks on aerobic/resistance training activities at 3-4 sessions per week.</p>


    <li>
        Reduction in alcohol indulgence
    </li>
    <p>Discretion in regards to consumption of alcohol beverages would help to maintain a stable blood pressure.</p>
